# Build FSMP MCM

Compiles the Papyrus source scripts (`.psc`) into compiled Papyrus executables (`.pex`) using the Caprica compiler. This project uses in-repo stubs for all dependencies, making it easy to build without external setup.

## Prerequisites

- **Caprica Compiler**: `Caprica/Caprica.exe` must be present. 
  - If missing, download it from [Orvid/Caprica Releases](https://github.com/Orvid/Caprica/releases).
- **PowerShell**: Used to run the build script.

## Build Command

// turbo
1. Run the compilation script from the repository root:

```powershell
./scripts/compile.ps1
```

The compiled `.pex` files will be placed in the `Scripts/` directory.

## Alternative: Papyrus Project (.ppj)

You can also use the `skyrimse.ppj` file with any Papyrus project runner (like `Pypro` or `Caprica` directly if your version supports it).

```powershell
./Caprica/Caprica.exe skyrimse.ppj
```

## Notes

- The build script uses the `--ignorecwd` flag to prevent Caprica from auto-adding the CWD to imports, avoiding namespace conflicts.
- It also uses `--game skyrim` for Skyrim-specific compatibility.
- Warning `W4007` about `loadConfigDone` being unused is expected and harmless.
